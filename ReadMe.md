Using our platform, the user has to fill a registration form providing necessary details which will be shared to the hospital. Then, the user can choose from available date and time slots, make an online payment. Later, the user can visit the chosen hospital according to the scheduled appointment.

Why our platform?

  1.Proper Management of Vaccine Distribution.
  
  2.Database of all vaccinated people.
